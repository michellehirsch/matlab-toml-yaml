## Overview

This RFA describes a MATLAB toolbox for reading and writing YAML, TOML, JSON, and INI configuration files using dot notation access. The toolbox targets MATLAB R2022b+ and requires no external dependencies.

**Core design choices:**
- Returns `YAMLData` / `TOMLData` value class objects — not plain structs — to support keys with hyphens and other special characters ubiquitous in real config files
- Data round-trip fidelity: values are preserved through read → modify → write; comments and formatting are not
- Pure MATLAB implementation: no Java libraries, MEX files, or toolbox dependencies
